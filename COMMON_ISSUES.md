Common Issues
=============

Having an issue with twilio-video.js? Unable to see remote Participants' Tracks?
Review this list of common issues to determine whether or not your issue is
known or a workaround is available. Please also take a look at the
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to see if your issue is known for a particular
release. If your issue hasn't been reported, consider submitting
[a new issue](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video.js/issues/new).

Chrome and Firefox Beta, Canary, Nightly, etc., Releases
--------------------------------------------------------

We always ensure compatibility with the current Chrome and Firefox stable
releases; however, because some of the APIs we rely upon, like WebRTC, are under
active development in the browsers, we cannot guarantee compatibility with
Canary or Nightly releases. We will, however, stay abreast of changes in browser
beta releases so that we can adopt changes in advance of each browser's next
stable release.

Safari
------

twilio-video.js 1.2.1 introduces experimental support for Safari 11 and newer.
Support for Safari is "experimental" because, at the time of writing, Safari
does not support VP8. This means you may experience codec issues in Group Rooms.
You may also experience codec issues in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Rooms containing
Android- or iOS-based Participants who do not support H.264. However, P2P Rooms
with browser-based Participants should work.

Microsoft Edge
--------------

Although Microsoft Edge includes some WebRTC support, it also includes some
limitations that make it difficult to support today. We plan on adding Edge
support to twilio-video.js, but we may do so by leveraging Edge's ORTC APIs
instead.

Internet Explorer and WebRTC-incompatible Browsers
--------------------------------------------------

twilio-video.js requires WebRTC, which is not supported by Internet Explorer.
While twilio-video.js will load in Internet Explorer and other browsers that
do not support WebRTC, attempting to connect to a Room or attempting to acquire
LocalTracks will fail.

VideoTrack shared by Firefox appears black
------------------------------------------

This issue can occur when connecting to a peer-to-peer Room with a Firefox-based
Participant who is not sharing audio. (If all the other Participants are
Firefox-based, this issue will not occur.) The issue arises due to a difference
in bundle behavior between Google and Mozilla's WebRTC implementations. For
more information, see [Issue 6280](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=6280)
on the WebRTC bug tracker.

The suggested workaround is to always share audio from Firefox-based
Participants when connecting to a peer-to-peer Room. If you do not intend to
playback the audio, you can `disable` the Track before connecting. For example,
using the microphone:

```js
const audioTrack = await Twilio.Video.createLocalAudioTrack();
audioTrack.disable();
```

Or, if you do not want to request microphone access, create a "dummy" Track
using the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API):

```js
const audioContext = typeof AudioContext !== 'undefined'
  ? new AudioContext()
  : new webkitAudioContext()
const node = audioContext.createMediaStreamDestination()
const stream = node.stream
const dummyTrack = stream.getAudioTracks()[0]
const audioTrack = new Twilio.Video.LocalAudioTrack(dummyTrack);
```

Then, pass the `audioTrack` to `connect`:

```js
const room = await Twilio.Video.connect(token, { tracks: [audioTrack] });
```

Aggressive Browser Extensions and Plugins
-----------------------------------------

Some browser extensions and plugins will disable WebRTC APIs, causing
twilio-video.js to fail. Examples of such plugins include

* uBlockOrigin-Extra
* WebRTC Leak Prevent
* Easy WebRTC Block

These are unsupported and likely to break twilio-video.js. If you are having
trouble with twilio-video.js, ensure these are not running.
