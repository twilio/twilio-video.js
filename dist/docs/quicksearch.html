Note that this is a beta release. You may encounter bugs and instability, and the APIs available in this release may change in subsequent releases. We want your feedback! Email Rob Brazier, Product Manager for Programmable Video at rbrazier@twilio.com with suggested improvements, feature requests and general feedback. If you need technical support, contact help@twilio.com. InstallationNPMnpm install twilio-video --saveBowerUntil we release twilio-video.js 1.0.0 proper, you must specify a specific pre-release. For example, bower install twilio-video#1.0.0-beta4 --saveCDNReleases of twilio-video.js are hosted on a CDN, and you can include these directly in your web app using a &lt;script&gt; tag. &lt;script src=&quot;//media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/js/video/v1/twilio-video.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;UsageThe following is a simple example showing a Client connecting to a Room. For more information, refer to the API Docs. const Video = require('twilio-video'); const client = new Video.Client('$TOKEN'); client.connect({ to: 'room-name' }).then(room =&gt; { console.log('Connected to Room &quot;%s&quot;', room.name); room.participants.forEach(participant =&gt; { console.log('Participant &quot;%s&quot; is connected', participant.identity); participant.media.attach(document.body); }); room.on('participantConnected', participant =&gt; { console.log('Participant &quot;%s&quot; connected', participant.identity); participant.media.attach(document.body); }); room.on('participantDisconnected', participant =&gt; { console.log('Participant &quot;%s&quot; disconnected', participant.identity); }); });ChangelogSee CHANGELOG.md.
