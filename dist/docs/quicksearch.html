Note that this is a beta release. You may encounter bugs and instability, and the APIs available in this release may change in subsequent releases. We want your feedback! Email Rob Brazier, Product Manager for Programmable Video at rbrazier@twilio.com with suggested improvements, feature requests and general feedback. If you need technical support, contact help@twilio.com. InstallationNPMnpm install twilio-video --saveBowerbower install twilio-video --saveCDNReleases of twilio-video.js are hosted on a CDN, and you can include these directly in your web app using a &lt;script&gt; tag. &lt;script src=&quot;//media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/js/video/v1/twilio-video.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;UsageThe following is a simple example showing a Client connecting to a Room. For more information, refer to the API Docs. const Video = require('twilio-video'); const client = new Video.Client('$TOKEN'); client.connect({ to: 'room-name' }).then(room =&gt; { console.log('Connected to Room &quot;%s&quot;', room.name); room.participants.forEach(participant =&gt; { console.log('Participant &quot;%s&quot; is connected', participant.identity); participant.media.attach(document.body); }); room.on('participantConnected', participant =&gt; { console.log('Participant &quot;%s&quot; connected', participant.identity); participant.media.attach(document.body); }); room.on('participantDisconnected', participant =&gt; { console.log('Participant &quot;%s&quot; disconnected', participant.identity); }); });ChangelogSee CHANGELOG.md. LicenseSee LICENSE.md. BuildingFork and clone the repository. Then, install dependencies with npm install npm install gulp -gPart of the build process involves running integration tests against Twilio. In order to run these, you will need a Twilio account and you will need to set the following environment variables: ACCOUNT_SID SIGNING_KEY_SID SIGNING_KEY_SECRET CONFIGURATION_PROFILE_SID Alternatively, you can skip the integration tests by setting SKIP_INTEGRATION to &quot;true&quot;. Then, run gulpThe builds and docs will be placed in the dist/ directory. ContributingBug fixes welcome!
