2.0.0-beta7 (in progress)
=========================

New Features
------------

- Added VP8 simulcast support for Safari. VP8 codec support is enabled in Safari
  12.1 which is currently in Beta. (JSDK-2315)

2.0.0-beta6 (March 15, 2019)
============================

New Features
------------
- [Dominant Speaker](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/detecting-dominant-speaker)
  and [Network Quality](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/using-network-quality-api)
  APIs are now generally available.
- twilio-video.js now supports versions of Safari that enable Unified Plan as the
  default SDP format. As of now, Unified Plan is enabled by default in the latest
  Safari Technology Preview. (JSDK-2306)
- Network reconnection is now supported as an opt-in feature. Previously, Participants
  would be disconnected from the Room during network disruptions or handoffs. This
  feature allows Participants to remain connected to the Room.

  To try this new feature in your application **you must perform the following steps**:

  1. Set the Time-To-Live (TTL) of your [AccessToken](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/tutorials/user-identity-access-tokens)
     to the maximum allowed session duration, currently 14400 seconds (4 hours).
     This ensures that when a network loss occurs the client will be able to
     re-authenticate the reconnection. Note, a reconnection attempt with an expired
     AccessToken will result in an [AccessTokenExpiredError](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/20104).
  2. Ensure that the [AccessToken]((https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/tutorials/user-identity-access-tokens))
     does not contain a configuration profile sid. Configuration profiles were
     deprecated when we [announced](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/04/programmable-video-peer-to-peer-rooms-ga.html#room-based-access-control)
     the general availability of twilio-video.js@1.0.0. Configuration profiles are
     not supported when using this feature.
  3. Enable the feature using the temporary flag `_useTwilioConnection` as follows:

     ```js
     const { connect } = require('twilio-video');
     const room = await connect(token, {
       _useTwilioConnection: true
     });
     ```

  4. The reconnecting event will now raise a [SignalingConnectionDisconnectedError](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/53001)
     when a signaling connection network disruption occurs. Previously, the reconnecting
     event only raised a [MediaConnectionError](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/53405).
     You can differentiate between errors in the handler as follows:

     ```js
     room.on('reconnecting', error => {
       if (error.code === 53001) {
         console.log('Reconnecting your signaling connection!', error.message);
       } else if (error.code === 53405) {
         console.log('Reconnecting your media connection!', error.message);
       }
     });
     ```

  5. When a Participant closes the tab/browser or navigates away from your application,
     we recommend that you disconnect from the Room so that other Participants are
     immediately notified. You can achieve this as follows:

     ```js
     window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
       room.disconnect();
     });
     ```

  After twilio-video.js@2.0.0 is generally available, we plan to make this an opt-out
  feature in twilio-video.js@2.1.0, followed by removing our existing SIP-based
  signaling transport altogether in twilio-video.js@2.2.0.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where `Room.getStats` was throwing a TypeError in Electron 3.x. (JSDK-2267)
- Fixed a bug where the LocalParticipant sometimes failed to publish a LocalTrack
  to a group Room due to media negotiation failure. (JSDK-2219)
- Removed workaround for this [Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1481335)
  on Firefox 65 and above. (JSDK-2280)
- Fixed a bug where passing invalid RTCIceServer urls in ConnectOptions did not
  raise a MediaConnectionError. (JSDK-2279)

2.0.0-beta5 (January 7, 2019)
=============================

New Features
------------

- `Room.getStats` on Firefox will now consume the spec-compliant `RTCIceCandidateStats`
  available in [versions 65 and above](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2018/rtcicecandidatestats-has-been-updated-to-the-latest-spec/). (JSDK-2235)
- Participants will now be able to stay in the Room and recover their media
  connections if the media server becomes unresponsive, instead of being
  disconnected. (JSDK-2245)
- `Room.getStats` is now supported on versions of Safari that enable Unified Plan
  as the default SDP format. It is not supported on earlier versions due to this
  [Safari bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192601).
  We have updated the documentation to reflect this behavior. (JSDK-2201)
- `Room.getStats` on Chrome now uses the WebRTC 1.0 compliant version of the
  RTCPeerConnection's `getStats` API. (JSDK-2182)
- Worked around Firefox 63's [deprecation](https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/getstats-isremote-65/)
  of the `isRemote` property in `RTCInboundRTPStreamStats` and `RTCOutboundRTPStreamStats`. (JSDK-2222)

2.0.0-beta4 (November 29, 2018)
===============================

Bug Fixes
---------

  - Fixed a bug where, when a Safari Participant joins a Room after a Firefox Participant,
    it did not receive video frames for VideoTracks published by the Firefox Participant. (JSDK-2224)

2.0.0-beta3 (November 20, 2018)
===============================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where unpublishing a LocalTrack from within one of its event
  listeners that have been added before publishing it to the Room throws a
  TypeError. (JSDK-2212)

Note for Electron developers
----------------------------

- twilio-video.js will no longer be usable on Electron 2.x or below. Please
  upgrade to Electron 3.x or higher.

2.0.0-beta2 (October 1, 2018)
=============================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where calling a LocalVideoTrack's `stop` method did not stop the
  video capture, and thereby did not turn the camera light off. (JSDK-2156)
- Fixed a bug where calling LocalParticipant's `unpublishTrack` on a LocalTrack
  that was being published to a Room also stopped the LocalTrack. (JSDK-2169) 

2.0.0-beta1 (August 10, 2018)
=============================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Google Chrome, starting from version 72, will enable Unified Plan as the default
  SDP format. This version of twilio-video.js will choose Plan B as the SDP format
  in order to continue supporting Google Chrome versions 72 and above until Unified
  Plan support is added. For more details, please refer to this [advisory](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012782494-Breaking-Changes-in-Twilio-Video-JavaScript-SDKs-December-2018-).
- RemoteParticipant no longer emits the deprecated "trackAdded" and "trackRemoved"
  events. Use the "trackSubscribed" and "trackUnsubscribed" events instead.
- LocalParticipant no longer contains the deprecated `addTrack`, `addTracks`,
  `removeTrack` and `removeTracks` methods. Use `publishTrack`, `publishTracks`,
  `unpublishTrack`, and `unpublishTracks` instead.
- RemoteTrack no longer has the deprecated `id` property. Use the `sid` or `name`
  properties instead.
- RemoteTrack no longer has the deprecated `isSubscribed` property. Use the
  corresponding RemoteTrackPublication's `isSubscribed` property instead.
- RemoteTrack no longer emits the deprecated "unsubscribed" event. Use the
  corresponding RemoteTrackPublication's "unsubscribed" event instead.
- Participant's `trackPublications` collection is now renamed to `tracks`.
  Similarly, `audioTrackPublications` is now renamed to `audioTracks`,
  `dataTrackPublications` is now renamed to `dataTracks`, and
  `videoTrackPublications` is now renamed to `videoTracks`. Participant no
  longer maintains the deprecated Track-based collections.
- We removed support for Bower.
